# ðŸ›’ Market Basket Analysis

This project simulates a real-world scenario of Market Basket Analysis using transaction data to uncover hidden patterns in customer purchasing behavior. The goal is to identify associations between items frequently bought together using association rule mining.

This type of analysis is widely used in retail to drive strategies for cross-selling, product placement, and promotional campaigns.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Identify frequent item combinations using the Apriori algorithm
- Generate association rules with high confidence and lift
- Visualize product relationships using a network graph
- Simulate potential business impact for cross-selling

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- **Python** â€“ for all data analysis
- **Pandas** â€“ for data preparation
- **mlxtend** â€“ for Apriori algorithm and association rules
- **Matplotlib & NetworkX** â€“ to create a product network graph
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ to present the analysis step by step
- **Power BI (optional)** â€“ for dashboard reporting (not included)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Outcomes

- 7 strong association rules found (confidence > 75%)
- Suggested cross-promotions based on product pairings
- Simulated up to **8% increase in monthly sales**
